# finmath smart derivative contracts

****************************************

**Algorithms and methodologies related to smart derivative contracts.**

****************************************

## Introduction

The finmath smart-derivative-contract project provides open source implementations of methodologies related to *smart
derivative contracts* in *Java* and *Solidity*.

The projects contain multiple parts: documentation, schema definitions (XML), demo code, valuation oracle.

## Literature

For a technical/mathematical description of the concept of a smart derivative contract
see https://ssrn.com/abstract=3163074

For non-technical description see the [articles](articles) section.

## Standards (Protocols)

For details see the [solidity page](solidity).

### ERC-6123 Smart Derivative Contract

See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6123

### ERC-7573 Secure Delivery-versus-Payment

See [ERC 7573](solidity/erc-7573.md).

## Visualization and Demonstration

The package `net.finmath.smartcontract.demo`contains a visualization of a smart derivative contract.
This is a Java FX application. Run `VisualiserSDC` or `scripts/start-demo-visualization.sh`.

## Valuation Service (ReST service)

**You may also run the valuation service through our Docker image (see below).**

If you like to run the the valuation service locally from this repository, running `mvn spring-boot:run` or
runnning `net.finmath.smartcontract.service.Appplication` starts a
ReST service providing a valuation oracle.

Username and password are configured in the `application.yml`. Default values are `user1` and `password1`.

### Swagger UI for the ReST Enpoints

Once the service is running, a swappger UI is available under `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

### Simple UI for the Endpoints

A simple UI is provided under `https://localhost:8080`.

### Enpoints

The enpoint `https://localhost:8080/valuation/value` allows the valuation of a financial product under given market
data.

The enpoint `https://localhost:8080/valuation/margin` allows the calculation of the settlement amount between two market
data sets.

The market data has to be provided as a JSON.
The product data as to be provided as an XML (containing a part being an FPML of the underlying product).

See also `api.yml`.

### Value

The endpoint value calculates the value of a financial product
with given market data.

The endpoint parameters are

- product P
- market data M
- valuation time t (see note below)

**Note**: The valuation time t is currently taken from the market data set M

The result is the value

- V(P,M,t)

**Note**: The valuation time t is currently taken from the market data set M1

### Margin

The enpoint parameters are

- product P
- market data M0 (market data at previous margin call or initial valuation)
- market data M1 (market data for margin call)
- valuation time t (see note below)

The result is the value

- M(P,M0,M1,t) = V(P,M1,t) - V(P,M0,t)

**Note**: The valuation time t is currently taken from the market data set M1

### Valuation Library

The underlying valuation library is [finmath lib](https://finmath.net/finmath-lib).

## Settlement Amount Oracle and Valuation Oracle

The package `net.finmath.smartcontract.oracle` contains the interface describing a so called oracle providing the
settlement amount for a smart derivative contract. The package contains also an implementation for interest rate swaps.

## State Machine Model for a Smart Derivative Contract

The package `net.finmath.smartcontract.statemachine` contains a simple state machine modeling a smart derivative
contract.
*This part may be somewhat outdated as we did not reflect recent changes to the Solidity implementation in the
state machine, but it still contains the main ideas.*

## Financial Product Description

The smart derivative contract is described in terms of the sdc.xml.

For a sample XML and the XSD see `resources/net/finmath/smartcontract/product/xml`.

## Docker: Running Valuation Service

See [Valuation Service](valuationservice.md).

## Docker: Building the Docker Container

See [Docker Build](dockerbuild.md).
