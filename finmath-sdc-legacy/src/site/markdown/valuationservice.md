# Valuation Service (ReST service)

If you like to run the valuation service locally from this repository, running `mvn spring-boot:run` or
runnning `net.finmath.smartcontract.service.Appplication` starts a
ReST service providing a valuation oracle.

## Docker: Running Valuation Service

### Run the Docker Container (starts Valuation Service)

**Important:** provide users and passwords via an `application.yml` file that resides
in `/PATH/TO/YOUR/CONFIG` (on the machine running Docker) (see Section "Config" below for the format of that file).

To run Docker Container with the image from Docker Hub execute following commands.

```
docker run -v /PATH/TO/YOUR/CONFIG:/workspace/config -p 8080:8080 finmath/finmath-smart-derivative-contract:1.0.1
```

The service will be available at http://localhost:8080/index.html

You can also then try the service out on its OpenAPI page:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
or
https://localhost:8443/swagger-ui/index.html

### Config

A sample `application.yml` is

```
data:
  sdc:
    users:
      - username: user1
        password: password1
        role: USER_ONE
      - username: user2
        password: password2
        role: USER_TWO
```

### Testing the Valuation Service

Clone this repository, if not done yet:

```
git clone https://github.com/finmath/finmath-smart-derivative-contract.git
cd finmath-smart-derivative-contract
```

Run

```
./scripts/test-margin-valuation-oracle.sh https://localhost:8080 user:password
```

where `user` is a username configured in the `application.yml` (in `/PATH/TO/YOUR/CONFIG`)
and  `password` is the corresponding password configured in the `application.yml` (in `/PATH/TO/YOUR/CONFIG`) .

Change the hostname as required.

### Running the service on https 8443

In the above application.yml add

```
server:
  ssl:
    key-store: /config/keyfile.p12
    key-store-password: password
    key-store-type: pkcs12
  port: 8443
```

Then place the keyfile (here `keyfile.p12` at the stated location (here `/config` (the folder mounted by our Docker
commands).

#### Generating a certificate

```
keytool -genkeypair -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore config/finmath.p12 -validity 365 -alias finmath -ext "SAN=IP:127.0.0.1" -dname "CN=127.0.0.1"
```

*Note:* change the file (keystore), the validity, the alias, and the IP/domain name as required

For choosing CN an SAN
see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5935369/how-do-common-names-cn-and-subject-alternative-names-san-work-together

#### Get the corresponding .cer file

```
openssl pkcs12 -in config/finmath.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out config/finmath.cer
keytool -printcert -file config/finmath.cer
```

*Note:* change the files as required

#### Import a .cer file into the truststore (cacert)

```
keytool -import -file config/finmath.cer -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -alias finmath
```

*Note:* change the files and the alias as required

#### Import a .pem file into the truststore (cacert)

```
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -file config/finmath.pem -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -alias finmath
```

#### Delete an alias from the truststrore

```
keytool -delete -alias mykey -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit
```

#### Test the service with https

```
./scripts/test-margin-valuation-oracle.sh https://localhost:8443 user1:password1
```

## Enpoints

The enpoint `https://localhost:8080/valuation/value` allows the valuation of a financial product under given market
data.

The enpoint `https://localhost:8080/valuation/margin` allows the calculation of the settlement amount between two market
data sets.

The market data has to be provided as a JSON.
The product data as to be provided as an XML (containing a part being an FPML of the underlying product).

See also `api.yml`.

## Value

The endpoint value calculates the value of a financial product
with given market data.

The endpoint parameters are

- product P
- market data M
- valuation time t (see note below)

**Note**: The valuation time t is currently taken from the market data set M

The result is the value

- V(P,M,t)

**Note**: The valuation time t is currently taken from the market data set M1

## Margin

The enpoint parameters are

- product P
- market data M0 (market data at previous margin call or initial valuation)
- market data M1 (market data for margin call)
- valuation time t (see note below)

The result is the value

- M(P,M0,M1,t) = V(P,M1,t) - V(P,M0,t)

**Note**: The valuation time t is currently taken from the market data set M1

## Valuation Library

The underlying valuation library is [finmath lib](https://finmath.net/finmath-lib).
