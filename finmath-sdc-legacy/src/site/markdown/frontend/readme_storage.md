# This is about the features that requires server side storage. The project main README is README.md

## What is it that requires server side storage?

Saving/loading preliminary contracts and uploading own market data. The implementation for both these features is to be
considered experimental.

## How do I tell the server application where to save data?

Edit `storage.basedir` in `src/main/resources/application.yml`. Spring handling of disk storage is defined by a complex
API: when it comes to accessing the
disk, an absolute path is needed.

## What does the folder structure used by the application mean?

Folders follow the `username.foldername` naming convention. For now naming is hardcoded as if `user1` is the only one
existing. This is not a definitive solution: if usage of the filesystem as a database is the definitive choice, small
modifications to the `PlainSwapEditorController` are needed. Also, the server should care a bit better about file
ownership. If instead this solution is to be abandoned in favor of a full DBMS approach, this does not apply.

## Why aren't the contract templates and schemas handled in the same way?

Every template more or less corresponds to a standard contract. There aren't that many, they can be considered as
program resources. Nonetheless, using disk storage instead of program resources for this requires minimal changes.

## Why is there just one file for market data?

It's a rolling file. Market data changes rapidly, so storing the old data might not be too useful (for now). Still,
usage of the same framework that is in place for the preliminary contracts allows this to be easily changed later.

## What is the format for market data?

It's a non-standard JSON. See `md_testset2.json`. We won't make the tools for generation of those files
public because of legal compliance reasons.
