<h1>Rethinking Financial Derivatives - Motivation</h1>
<p>The content of this site is taken from the
following <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3249430" class="externalLink">publication</a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>On September 15, 2008, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Years later some claims still
remain unsettled. Although Lehman&#x2019;s derivative portfolio was not the reason for its bankruptcy, its notional of $35
trillion accounted for 5% of the total derivative market.Derivative contracts remain relevant tools for risk management
and the global economy. In 2017,the notional of the OTC derivative market was $530 trillion and accounted for a market
value of $12 trillion. Despite extensive regulatory changes and improvements, settlement risks of derivatives remain
complex and hard to manage &#x2013; and hence costly.Is it possible to use technologies like Distributed Ledgers and Smart
Contracts to rethink derivatives from scratch? In this note we try to provide some answers.</p>
</blockquote></section><section>
<h1>Nature of OTC Derivatives</h1><section>
<h2>Important instruments</h2>
<p>Financial derivatives are essential tools in risk management with economic value added, e.g. to reduce market risk. For
example, by using interest rate swaps, the interest rate risk of a loan can be managed. However, a classical
&#x201c;Over-The-Counter&#x201d;  (OTC)  derivative carries its own risk resulting from the bilateral contractual relationship. A
prominent example is the counterparty risk related to the possibility of bankruptcy of the derivative counterparty.</p></section><section>
<h2>Risk Management or Reduction</h2>
<p>The common approach is to manage and control risk as good as possible and dedicate capital reserves to the remaining
risk. This approach results in complex processes and high costs in the end. A proactive reduction of risk or even the
complete removal of risk is desirable, not only because it is cheaper.</p></section><section>
<h2>Regulatory Improvements</h2>
<p>After the 2008 financial crisis regulators tried to successively improve the handling of derivative risk. Higher capital
charges and processing costs put pressure on banks to improve their risk management and transaction processing
front-to-back from trading over risk control to operations.</p></section><section>
<h2>Complexity which does not exists need not be reduced</h2>
<p>Many processes in the derivative business exist for historical reasons. Due to the high volume of the existing
derivative positions, changes remain difficult. However, present technological advances and the increasing digital
transformation of business processes demand for a review of derivative processes in regard of their complexity.How about
rethinking derivatives that way? Complexity that does not exist, need not be reduced. Risk that does not exist by
construction, need not be managed. Is this possible?</p></section></section><section>
<h1>Derivatives Markets today</h1><section>
<h2>Counterparty Credit Risk</h2>
<p>In case of a bankruptcy of a derivative counterpart the remaining party is forced to manage the resulting open risk
positions by entering into new derivative contracts. This can lead to significant replacement costs since a bank's
insolvency can lead to large market disruptions. Collateral processes are supposed to mitigate those replacement risks.
If the market value of a derivative portfolio represents a liability, it has to be collateralised by posing cash or
securities as collateral.</p></section><section>
<h2>Collateral and Settlement Risk</h2>
<p>The collateral exchange process, however, has procedural problems and inefficiencies which prevent final elimination of
counterparty credit risk. The value of collateral is based on the portfolio&#x2019;s market value and is determined by each
counterparty separately. If counterparties disagree on the collateral value, this dispute may leave the actual claim
insufficiently collateralised.Another example for an inefficiency results from non-synchronised bookings of derivative
cash-flows and collateral postings. The booking of a contractual derivative cash flow,e.g. the payment of a fixed rate,
will result in an opposite booking of respective collateral and will be transferred back to the payer usually with a
timely offset.Such redundant bookings generate unnecessary settlement risks which especially will become evident in case
of a looming bankruptcy.</p></section><section>
<h2>CCP and Initial Margin</h2>
<p>With the introduction of &#x201c;European Market Infrastructure Regulation(EMIR)&#x201d; in 2012 the EU has put stronger regulations
on the OTC derivatives market with the objective of increasing transparency and reduce existing risks. Within that
framework the clearing obligation for plain interest rate swap derivatives was introduced in 2016. Counterparties are
not allowed to process the derivative&#x2019;s life-cycle bilaterally but are forced to contract over a third institution&#x2013;the
clearing house. For all remaining derivatives which are not subject to clearing obligation and therefore still have to
be processed bilaterally, e.g. cross currency swaps, a bilateral initial obligation was launched in 2017. Both
counterparties are obliged to post additional collateral to a custodian with the aim to cover potential losses due to
insufficient collateralised claims.</p></section><section>
<h2>Is Risk removed?</h2>
<p>Despite all those attempts counterparty credit risk has not been eliminated. On the one hand, the risk has been
concentrate don few central hubs; on the other hand, it has been transformed into new elements of costs.A clearing house
itself is also exposed to the risk of insolvency of one of its clearing members and can get into serious difficulties.
Complex processes, including the so-called &#x201c;Default Waterfall&#x201d; process, are put into place to prevent such a situation
from happening.But especially in a critical crisis scenario one thing is definitely undesired:  Complex mechanisms
unwinding in a strained market on a highly aggregated derivative volume. Looking at the bilateral initial margin
obligation, which enters its third phase right now, one may observe that the additional collateral to be posted results
in a strongly increasing funding demand. Essentially counterparty credit risk gets
transformed into liquidity costs.</p></section></section>
